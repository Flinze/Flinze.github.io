            <b>Get Checked online information example:</b> <br>
            Can test for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and Hepatitis C for some people.<br>
            How it works:<br>
        Create an account on GetCheckedOnline.com, use code “community” to make one. <br>
        If asked about personal information, you can use a fake name, DOB, and a throwaway email.<br>
        Note: No ID is asked for at any time during registration or testing, regardless if you have BC healthcare or not, and there are no fees. <br>
        If you use a fake name, you will need to remember it.<br>
        Go through a quick risk assessment <br>
        Based on the questionnaire, you will be recommended on certain tests, and a lab form will be generated. <br>
        This will need to be printed and brought to a LifeLabs location which is listed. <br>
        The lab form has your name or fake name replaced with a number so that the lab doesn’t know anything other than your stated DOB, test requests and sex.<br>
        Go to LifeLabs (drop-in) or create an anonymous appointment on their website.<br>
        Remember to keep your name consistent<br>
        Follow the instructions for the tests at the lab<br>
        Stuff you do yourself: Swab anus/throat, pee in a cup<br>
        Stuff they do for you: Get blood drawn<br>
        Results will be sent to you within 7-10 days, if you’re positive for something a nurse will email/call you (if they have your number). If your test is negative, they send you an email to check results online.<br>
        <br>
            Good things about this:
        No need to ask a doctor 
        Can get tested within the same day
        No waiting at a clinic to get a referral/track down STI clinics
        No need to talk to someone else about your sexual experiences
        Entire process is confidential, anonymous, and free!
